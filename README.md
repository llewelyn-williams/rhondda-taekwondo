## User Experience Design


### Strategy

The website is aimed at prospective students considering joining a martial arts club and parents looking to chose a martial arts club for their child or children.

Users will expect responsive design and seamless use of familiar conventions to access the information that they want to see as simply as possible.

Both the user and owner should mutually benefit from a sense on confidence being established in the club, leading to users being inspired to either join up or make contact.

### Scope

#### Problems to Solve
People currently don't know:
 - the club exists
 - what the club does
 - what the club offers
 - how to get it from the club
 
Neither are they:
 - joining the club
 - engaging with the club

The target is a website with low complexity, that is however visually and functionally well polished and creates a sense of trust.

#### User Stories

| Scenario | Requirements  |
|----------|---------------|
| **As a parent**, I want to see information about where the club is, when the classes run, what the cost is and what my child will learn, so I can assess if it is a good fit for our family. | The information they are looking for needs to be present and quick and simple to access. |
| I want to be able to ask questions I might have, to help me make a decision or get an even better picture of the club. | Provide method and means of contact.|
| I want to know my child will  be safe. | Provide details of how the club approaches safety. |
| **As a potential student**, I want to find out when the classes run, what the cost is and what I will learn, so I can assess if it is a good fit for myself. | The information they are looking for needs to be present and quick and simple to access.|

### Surface

The design uses a predominately black and white colour scheme inspired by the dobok (taekwondo uniform) and the taegukgi (flag of South Korea). Clean straight lines with high contrast reflect the visual representation of taekwondo the work over as well as lending to the sense of efficiency and directness, reflected in the style of the martial art. Links are in blue, one of the other colours found on the taegukgi, the blue also serving its place as the webâ€™s default colour for links, aiding speed of recognition.
